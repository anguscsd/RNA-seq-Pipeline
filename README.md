# RNA-Seq Data Processing and Analysis Pipeline

This repository contains scripts and documentation for processing and analyzing RNA-seq data as part of the **MET585 Bioinformatics Assessment**.  
The workflow demonstrates key steps in a typical next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis pipeline, from raw FASTQ processing through alignment, duplicate marking, and preparation for downstream transcriptomic analysis.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on building a **reproducible RNA-seq pipeline** using publicly available datasets and widely adopted bioinformatics tools.  
The pipeline processes paired-end reads, performs quality control, aligns reads to a reference genome, marks duplicates, and prepares the data for downstream analyses such as **gene expression quantification** and **splicing detection**.
